Rollbacks - to compile the software found here
as-is.  Maybe. ;)

 * git clone https://github.com/adafruit/ArduinoCore-samd.git

   Use the Arduino IDE; this is just for reference.

   Version info soon. ;)

   Visit:

   https://github.com/adafruit/ArduinoCore-samd/releases

This seems to be the one to point to the correct board support package:

   https://github.com/adafruit/arduino-board-index/tree/gh-pages/boards

   Version 1.2.9 likely.  9 months ago (from late August, 2019).

   The hint: Preferences dialog in Arduino IDE gives the .json locations
   used to install the board support packages.

   In the Arduino IDE, Tools > Board: > Boards Manager ... 
   then Adafruit SAMD Boards by Adafruit version 1.5.2 INSTALLED

   This is what is to be rolled back, to version 1.2.9 (LIKELY)

   Rolling this back has a lot of consequences, if you are doing
   any current work with the Adafruit SAMD series boards.

   Basically, you'd have to roll it forward again (to the current
   version) to avoid complex issues that *may* arise.

LIBRARIES

   In the Arduino IDE, select Tools > Manage Libraries ...

   and look for Adafruit SPI   Adafruit QSPI

   Adafruit SPIFlash by Adafruit
   https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SPIFlash

   1.0.6 and 1.0.8 are candidates.

   Start with 1.0.8 as that may've been the 'paydirt' one
   for recent efforts that did succeed.

   https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SPIFlash/releases/tag/1.0.8

   But use the Arduino IDE interface to do the install. ;)

   Is corrupted!

   3.1.1 was ('is') current in August 2019.

   1.0.6 did install through the IDE and will be tested, first.
   It is dated October 11, 2018.

   - - - -

   Now, QSPI

   https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_QSPI/releases

   for your own information, only. Again, use the Arduino IDE for
   the installation, itself.

   Version 1.0.2 very likely to work; it was dated October 11, 2018:

   https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_QSPI/releases/tag/1.0.2

   This one (Adafruit_QSPI) may be unavailable through the IDE,
   so the .ZIP file method will be used, instead (to get the
   rolled back lib).  Current lib may be rescinded.

   It's a good idea to close the Arduino IDE before putting the .ZIP
   file into your libraries directory.

   The unpacked .ZIP produces:

   Adafruit_QSPI-1.0.2  - a directory, which is to be renamed as:

   Adafruit_QSPI  using your operating system (Linux, Windows, MacOS)

   Note that this is a direct analogy for Adafruit_QSPI-master which
   is what you'd have if you just grabbed the .ZIP from the main page
   of this repository.

   Same exact idea.  The -1.0.2 helps you to understand that this
   is a (in this case, past) released version of the software.

   Linux people do it this way, if they like:

    $ mv     ./Adafruit_QSPI-1.0.2   ./Adafruit_QSPI
    $ mv     ./Adafruit_QSPI         ~/Arduino/libraries/
    $ ls -1  ~/Arduino/libraries | egrep    Adafruit_QSPI
    Adafruit_QSPI

   That assumes it was not there (at all) prior.
   Additional steps needed, if a version of this library
   was already there.

   Only then, restart the Arduino IDE. It will scan the
   ~/Arduino/libraries directory and pick up the new lib.

   GOOD COMPILE.  Mon Aug 26 02:14:28 UTC 2019

   The source compiles, when these three rollbacks were
   accomplished: The Board Support (SAMD), the SPIFlash
   and the QSPI libs (two libs and a board support package)
   (as I'm calling it; don't know the correct name for it).
