Plan: remove that #include as well. ;)

To answer this compiler complaint, the plan is simple: to remove the #include
from ainsuForth. ;)

SdFat - Adafruit Fork by Bill Greiman Version 1.2.1
This was reinstalled (had removed it for the testing;
it was not installed when the good compile happened
on 26 August).

This addressed the compiler complaint:

 ../libraries/Adafruit_SPIFlash/src/Adafruit_SPIFlash.h:35:19: fatal error: SdFat.h: No such file or directory
 #include "SdFat.h"
                   ^

The QSPI lib removed from Arduino IDE libraries directory,
as it is deprecated, iirc.

Next up: bring SPIFlash to current version, summer 2019. ;)

Adafruit SAMD boards 1.2.9 in Boards Manager updated to current day version.

This fixes the bossac issue, and creates no new ones
(at a glance; no detailed investigation of that).

Target (ItsyBitsyM4) was uploaded to correctly, and
a quick test (the 'load' word) shows basic flash still
functioning with the most recent BSP.

Adafruit SAMD Boards 1.5.3 is what was installed, just now.
Working fine.

An attempt to log some of the difficulties, fixes,
and such.  No guarantees it'll be useful to others;
these can be seen as 'notes to self' haha.
