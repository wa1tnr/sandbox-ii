The QSPI lib removed from Arduino IDE libraries directory,
as it is deprecated, iirc.

Next up: bring SPIFlash to current version, summer 2019. ;)

Adafruit SAMD boards 1.2.9 in Boards Manager updated to current day version.

This fixes the bossac issue, and creates no new ones
(at a glance; no detailed investigation of that).

Target (ItsyBitsyM4) was uploaded to correctly, and
a quick test (the 'load' word) shows basic flash still
functioning with the most recent BSP.

Adafruit SAMD Boards 1.5.3 is what was installed, just now.
Working fine.

An attempt to log some of the difficulties, fixes,
and such.  No guarantees it'll be useful to others;
these can be seen as 'notes to self' haha.
